# Final Project FlappyBird game - Mr Luke Class - Ved

- I made this project by following a youtube video, the youtuber is Kenny Yip Coding and he makes very good coding videos. 

- To run my flappyBird game go to the App class and just the code.

- In this project I learned how to make a game timer, 

- how to set up a JPANEL for the game, how to use downloaded picture and use those picture in your code.

- I really had fun making this project as I learned new things.
